**\*\* Since we are constantly working to improve our herd we reserve the right of FIRST CHOICE on any kid. Thank you.\*\***

<br />

Within a few hours of being born ND kids are very active. Running, playing, snuggling and laughing, children and goat kids thoroughly enjoy each otherâ€™s company. Nigerian Dwarf kids are the perfect size, clean, and totally harmless with the horns removed. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. This facilitates constant and safe handling for petting, milking, and showing. That way they wont accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.
