**\*\* Since we are constantly working to improve our herd we reserve the right of FIRST CHOICE on any kid. Thank you.\*\***

<br />

Within a few hours of being born ND kids are very active. Running, playing, snuggling and laughing, children and goat kids thoroughly enjoy each other’s company. Nigerian Dwarf kids are the perfect size, clean, and totally harmless with the horns removed. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. This facilitates constant and safe handling for petting, milking, and showing. That way they wont accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.
