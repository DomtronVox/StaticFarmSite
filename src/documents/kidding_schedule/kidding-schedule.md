**\*\* Since we are constantly working to improve our herd we reserve the right of FIRST CHOICE on any kid. Thank you.\*\***

<br />

Within a few hours of being born ND kids are very active. Running, playing, snuggling and laughing, children and goat kids thoroughly enjoy each otherâ€™s company. Nigerian Dwarf kids are the perfect size, clean, and totally harmless with the horns removed. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. This facilitates constant and safe handling for petting, milking, and showing. That way they wont accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.

* **Look over the kidding schedule. Like a breeding? Send a msg on the "Contact Us" page. I'm happy to put you on the "Wish List"! **
* ** I will contact you letting you know if your wish came true. A nonrefundable $100 deposit (paypal or personal check)  holds your kid while you arrange for pick up or transport.  No kids are held without a deposit.**
* **The balance is due before **(paypal)** or at time of pickup** (cash) **which should be within one month of birth.  By then they are eating solid food and should only need a bottle 2x /day. I am happy to switch your baby to store bought whole milk before pickup if you need me to. If you are having trouble with your arrangements and need us to keep them longer send a msg on the "Contact Us" page.  **
* **We do our best, but kids do get sick or die. If this happens before you pick up your kid, you can transfer the money paid to another kid OR we will refund your money.  **
* **PLEASE send me a msg (on the contact page)  if you have any questions about buying kids, refunds, or pickup.**
