  \* You never know what will come when planning milk tests… this was the year
  we had a death in the family and family sickness.. With all the irregularities
  in her schedule,  she still got her milk \*  in Butterfat and Protein but
  missed her milk * in vol by only a few pounds.  I am proud of her that she did
  this well.

Glamour is definitely the QUEEN of our goat herd. We were so glad to get the opportunity to buy her and introduce her to the next level with LA scores and DHIR milk tests. She is a dark gold and black buckskin random white spots
