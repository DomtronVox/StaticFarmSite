**Spicy has been with Graffiti for over 2 months so should be bred. Excellent chance of kids being polled.**  She kidded 2017 all by herself with absolutely no kidding problems.

Her daughter, ** Deer Ridge Twilight Cascabella 1*M**, out of ** Tx Twincreeks Edge of Twilight **already has her milk star.  

Black doe with random white spots
