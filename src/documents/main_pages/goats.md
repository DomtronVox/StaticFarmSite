**This small West African goat arrived in the U.S. and took American hearts by storm. They have spread through the U.S. like wildfire. What is so special about Nigerian Dwarf goats?**

**<br />**

**Nigerians are long and elegant, like miniature dairy goats, but under 24” tall. The breed standard is does (females) no more than 22.5” tall and bucks (males) no more than 23.5” tall. If not polled (genetically hornless) they are disbudded to facilitate constant and safe handling for petting, milking, and showing. Their coloring can be black, white, chocolate and gold appearing in solids, patterns, and spots. Their eye coloring can be any shade of brown or blue. Most owners of registered NDs breed for calm and safe dispositions. Unlike most standard goat breeds, Nigerians can have kids in any season. This means an even amount of milk year round for owners.**

**<br />**

**Nigerian Dwarf goats are a welcome addition to the homesteader.  They need smaller shelters and pens and a lot less food compared to full-sized goats. A couple of quarts a day of very high quality milk is easy to manage in your kitchen for drinking and making cheese, yogurt, fudge, and soap.**

**All goats are ruminants and need a lot of fiber. They adore woody shrubs like brambles, also poison ivy and honeysuckle, and will eat most weeds and grass.**
