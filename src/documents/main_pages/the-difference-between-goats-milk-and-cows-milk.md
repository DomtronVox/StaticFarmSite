Goat milk breaks down in the stomach in 20 minutes; it takes an hour/+ for the stomach to break down cow milk.

Goat milk may be drunk by people who are allergic to cow milk, but it contains lactose, so it may not be for people who are lactose-intolerant.

The major difference between cow milk and goat milk is that goat milk has smaller fat globules than cow milk, which makes it naturally homogenized and more easily digestible than cow milk.

Goat milk also has a higher butterfat content than cow milk.

Goat milk is a highly nourishing natural food for people who are allergic to cow milk.

Cow milk is mucus forming for many people. Goat milk is not only non-mucus forming, but actually helps to neutralize mucus.
