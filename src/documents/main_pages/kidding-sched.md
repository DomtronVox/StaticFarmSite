## Contact me with what doe/buck kid from what breeding you would WISH for. i will contact you when "your doe" kids letting you know  what is born.  A $100  nonrefundable deposit (paypal or ck)  holds your choice until you can pick it up or arrange for transporting it.  The balance, in cash/paypal, is due before or at time of pickup. Discounts can be worked out on multiple purchases.  I would like pick up within one month of birth. I bottle raise all babies and can switch your baby to  store bought whole milk if you need me to. I  disbud (if not polled) and worm all babies. Also start them on Di-Methox.   Also we give CD/T shots at least once a year to adults.  We give a CD/T shot to pregnant does within 1 month of kidding. This is passed to the babies in utero and gives them some protection at birth until they are able to get their own CD/T. All babies should be given one CD/T shot around 6 weeks old and another “booster” CD/T shot 21-28 days later.
