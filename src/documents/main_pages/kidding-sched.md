* **All babies are taught to accept a bottle with teat. We will supply a free bottle and teat per total purchase. if you want to buy extra there is a small surcharge.**
* **Look over the kidding schedule. **
* **Like a breeding? Let me know. I'm happy to put you on the "Wish List"! **
* ** I will contact you when "your doe" freshens (has babies) letting you know if your wish came true.  **
* **A nonrefundable $100 deposit (paypal or personal check)  holds your kid until you can pick it up or arrange for transport.  No kids are held without a deposit.**
* **The balance, is due before (paypal) or at time (cash) of pickup. **
* **Discounts are available on multiple purchases.  **
* **Pick up should be within one month of birth.  By then they should only need a bottle 2x /day.**
* **We do our best, but kids do get sick or die. If this happens before you pick up your kid, you can transfer the money paid to another kid OR we will refund your money.  **
* **Send me a msg (on the contact page)  if you have questions about refunds or pickup.**

## I bottle raise all babies and can switch your baby to  store bought whole milk if you need me to. I  disbud (if not polled) and worm all babies. Also start them on Di-Methox.   We give CD/T shots at least once a year to adults.  We give a CD/T shot and Bo-Se to pregnant does within 1 month of kidding. This is passed to the babies in utero and gives them some protection at birth until they are able to get their own CD/T. All babies should be given one CD/T shot around 6 weeks old and another “booster” CD/T shot 21-28 days later.
