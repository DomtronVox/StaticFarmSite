* **All babies are taught to accept a bottle with a prichard's teat. We will supply a free bottle and screw on teat per total purchase. if you want to buy extra there is a small surcharge.**
* **I  disbud (if not polled) and worm all babies. **
* **Also start them on Di-Methox (coccidiosis prevention) at three weeks old.   **
* ** We give a CD/T shot and Bo-Se to pregnant does within 1 month of kidding. This is passed to the babies in utero and gives them some protection at birth until they are able to get their own CD/T. All babies should be given one CD/T shot around 6 weeks old and another “booster” CD/T shot 21-28 days later.**

* **Look over the kidding schedule. **
* **Like a breeding? send a msg on the contact page. I'm happy to put you on the "Wish List"! **
* ** I will contact you when "your doe" freshens (has babies) letting you know if your wish came true.  **
* **A nonrefundable $100 deposit (paypal or personal check)  holds your kid until you can pick it up or arrange for transport.  No kids are held without a deposit.**
* **The balance is due before (paypal) or at time of pickup (cash). **
* **Discounts are available on multiple purchases.  **
* **Pick up time should be within one month of birth.  By then they should only need a bottle 2x /day. I am happy to switch your baby to store bought whole milk before pickup if you need me to.**
* **We do our best, but kids do get sick or die. If this happens before you pick up your kid, you can transfer the money paid to another kid OR we will refund your money.  **
* **PLEASE send me a msg (on the contact page)  if you have any questions about buying kids, refunds, or pickup.**
