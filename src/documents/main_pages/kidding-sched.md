Contact me with what doe/buck kid from what breeding you would WISH for. At time of kidding we will see what we get. :) a $100  nonrefundable deposit (paypal or ck)  holds your choice until you can pick it up or arrange for transporting it.  The balance, in cash/paypal, is due before or at time of pickup. I would like pick up within one month of birth. I bottle raise all babies and can switch your baby to  store bought whole milk if you need me to. I give all babies BoSe shots, disbud (if not polled) and worm them. Discounts can be worked out on group purchases.   \*\* Since we are constantly working to improve our herd we reserve the right of FIRST CHOICE on any kid. Thank you\*\*
