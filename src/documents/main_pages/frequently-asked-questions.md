**Frequently Asked Questions**

<br />

**I got my puppy home. WHAT NOW?**  We are happy to help you with questions. Also we strongly encourage you to join a group on facebook called ["Livestock Guardian Dogs and Positive Training Methods"  ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PositiveLGD/)They have many, many videos and posts you can read that are a BIG help.

<br />

**Do you sell disbudded goats?** If a goat is not born POLLED (genetically hornless) we always disbud them. There is an exception to that in that a horned kid born of one or both parents or even grandparents that are polled might not have the horn go through the skin until after you have picked it up. We will be glad to disbud for free in that case.

<br />

**What does POLLED mean?**  It means that the goat is genetically unable to produce horns.

<br />

**Do you test your goats?** Yes. That is very important to us. We test our whole herd yearly for CAE, Johnes, and Brucellosis. We have never had a case of CL in all the years we’ve been raising goats. Every year we randomly test a few goats for CL. DOZY DOE DOWN has always been NEGATIVE on all tests.

<br />

**Can I visit your farm and see your goats/puppies?**   Yes and no. If visitors are interested in coming to Dozy Doe Down, **WITH AN APPOINTMENT, **we can bring the goat/pup to a designated area at the front of the property. You must wear booties (that we provide) and wash your hands before petting the animal. But we are NOT a petting zoo and visitors are not allowed free access to roam Dozy Doe Down.   We feel very strongly about bio‑security. Diseases like Johnes can be tracked on shoes. We do the best we can  to keep our goats safe and one way is to restrict visitors’ access as much as possible.

<br />

**Do you accept credit cards or personal check?** We accept cash (USA) and PayPal. Personal checks must clear the bank before the animal can leave Dozy Doe Down.  We are not set up for credit cards.
