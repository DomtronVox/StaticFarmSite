## **Frequently Asked Questions**

<br />

**Do you accept credit cards or personal check?** We accept cash (USA) and PayPal. Personal checks must clear the bank before the animal can leave Dozy Doe Down.  We are not set up for credit cards. 

<br />

**Do you give discounts on goats?** Yes. 1) If you buy more than one goat at the same time. 2) If you are a "repeat buyer" 3) If you are already established in DHIR, 4-H.

<br />

**Why can't i just buy ONE goat?** You can IF you already have goats. Goats are like potato chips, you can't have just one! LOL   If you don't already have goats, we prefer to sell you wethers in groups of three, when possible. We feel so strongly about this that we offer a 50% discount on the third wether. Goats are herd animals. They HAVE TO have another goat friend otherwise they mope and cry, get stressed, and that leads to sickness.

<br />

Our policy used to be to start you with a minimum of two goats.  But over the years I've had people contact us in tears. They bought only one kid from someone else OR they had two goats but one died and the other was crying 24/7. And,** "please, do you have a wether I could buy to make my sad goat happy?"  **So now our policy is to sell in groups of three, when possible.  That way if something happens to one there are still two buddies left.  Less stress = less sickness.

<br />

**I got my puppy home. WHAT NOW?**  We are happy to help you with questions. Also we strongly encourage you to join a group on facebook called ["Livestock Guardian Dogs and Positive Training Methods"  ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PositiveLGD/)They have many, many videos and posts you can read that are a BIG help.

<br />

**Do you sell disbudded goats?** If a goat is not born POLLED (genetically hornless) we always disbud them. There is an exception to that in that a horned kid born of one or both parents or even grandparents that are polled might not have the horns go through the skin until after you have picked it up. If that happens, bring it back and we will be glad to disbud for free.

<br />

**What does POLLED mean?**  It means that the goat is genetically unable to produce horns.

<br />

**Do you test your goats?** Yes. That is very important to us. We test our whole herd yearly for CAE, Johnes, and Brucellosis. We have never had a case of CL in all the years we’ve been raising goats. Every year we randomly test a few goats for CL. DOZY DOE DOWN has always been NEGATIVE on all tests.

<br />

**Can I visit your farm and see your goats/puppies?**   Yes and no. We prefer to meet you off farm. But if visitors are interested in coming to Dozy Doe Down, **WITH AN APPOINTMENT, **we can bring the goat/pup to a designated area at the front of the property. You must wear booties (that we provide) and wash your hands before petting the animal. But we are NOT a petting zoo and visitors are not allowed free access to roam Dozy Doe Down.   We feel very strongly about bio‑security. We have shoes/boots that we wear JUST for the farm. Others shoes for off farm.  Diseases like Johnes can be tracked on shoes. We do the best we can  to keep our goats safe and one way is to restrict visitors’ access as much as possible. We're sure you can appreciate this policy when it comes times to buy YOUR goat.
