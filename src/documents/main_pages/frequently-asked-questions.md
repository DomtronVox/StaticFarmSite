**Frequently Asked Questions**

<br />

* **I got my puppy home. WHAT NOW?**  We are happy to help you with questions. Also we strongly encourage you to join a group on facebook called ["Livestock Guardian Dogs and Positive Training Methods"  ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PositiveLGD/)They have many, many videos and posts you can read that are a BIG help.

<br />

**Do you sell disbudded goats?** If a goat is not born POLLED (genetically hornless) we always disbud them. There is an exception to that in that a horned kid born of one or both parents or even grandparents that are polled might not have the horn go through the skin until after you have picked it up. We will be glad to disbud for free in that case.

<br />

**What does POLLED mean?**  It means that the goat is genetically unable to produce horns.

<br />

**Do you test your goats?** Yes. That is very important to us. We test our whole herd yearly for CAE, Johnes, and Brucellosis. We have never had a case of CL in all the years weâ€™ve been raising goats. Every year we randomly test a few goats for CL. DOZY DOE DOWN has always been NEGATIVE on all tests.
