We normally start with wethers when working with people having no goat experience. A wether is a castrated male. They make excellent pets, don't have that "bucky" smell, and are cheaper than registered does or bucks.

Just like any other new project, everyone has a learning curve with goats and will make mistakes. After you feel more comfortable with your wethers you can add a couple of new babies--this time does!  and when they are ready to be bred (at about 15 months old) you can get a buck and now YOU'RE IN BUSINESS!

Since you don't already have goats, our policy has been to start you with a minimum of two goats. Goats are herd animals. They HAVE TO have another goat friend otherwise they mope and cry, get stressed and that leads to sickness.

But over the past i've had a few people contact us in tears. They had bought only one kid from someone else OR they had two goats but one died and the other was crying 24/7. And --**would i sell them a goat??? **so now i prefer to sell in groups of three.That way if something happens to one there are still two buddies left. Less stress = less sickness.
