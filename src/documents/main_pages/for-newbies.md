**BEWARE: GOATS ARE ADDICTIVE! (bwahahaha)**

We prefer offering wethers (castrated males) when working with people having no goat experience.  Wethers make excellent pets, don't have that "bucky" smell, and are cheaper than registered does or bucks. Since you don't already have goats, i prefer to sell in groups of three, when possible. **WHY THREE?** you ask. 

<hr>

**Goats are like potato chips, you cant just one!** Goats are herd animals. They HAVE TO have another goat friend otherwise they mope and cry, get stressed and that leads to sickness. 

<hr>

Our policy used to be to start you with a minimum of two goats.  But over the years I've had a few people contact us in tears. They bought only one kid from someone else OR they had two goats but one died and the other was crying 24/7. And, "**would I sell them a goat???" ** 

<hr>

So now our policy is to sell in groups of three, when possible.  That way if something happens to one there are still two buddies left.  Less stress = less sickness.

Just like any other new project, everyone has a learning curve with goats and will make mistakes. After you feel more comfortable with your wethers you can add a couple of new babies--this time does!  and when they are ready to be bred (at about 15 months old) you can get a buck and now YOU'RE IN BUSINESS!
