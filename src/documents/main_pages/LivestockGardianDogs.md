What is a Livestock Guardian Dog (LGD)?    Some people think a LGD is a border collie or other herding dog.  No, this is in fact the opposite of a Livestock Guardian Dog.

They are very laid-back and careful of your livestock. They warn the owner when a baby is born, when an animal is hurt.   LGDs watch over and protect your herd 365/24/7. They bark to warn of danger to the flock, scaring off or killing small predators and will fight any large predators that invade your pens.
