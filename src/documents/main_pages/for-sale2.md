Our herd is tested at least once a year for CAE, Johnes, and Brucellosis. and we have never had a case of CL.  If you want additional testing of your goat BEFORE you pick it up, we will be glad to do so. The cost for the additional testing must be paid BEFORE we do  the test. 

<br />

we are very strict on bio-security here so you will not be able to walk around Dozy Doe Down. (Johnes can be tracked on shoes) BUT any animal you are interested in we will be happy to move to a pen at the entrance of our farm.
