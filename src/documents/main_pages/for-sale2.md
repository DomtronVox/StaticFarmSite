Our herd is tested at least once a year for CAE, Johnes, and Brucellosis. and we have never had a case of CL.  If you want additional testing of your goat BEFORE you pick it up, we will be glad to do so. The cost for the additional testing must be paid BEFORE we do  the test. 



we are very strict on bio-security here so you will not be able to walk around Dozy Doe Down. (Johnes can be tracked on shoes) BUT we are very glad to have you come see the goats in a pen at the entrance of our farm.
