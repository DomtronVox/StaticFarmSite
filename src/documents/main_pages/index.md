# About Us

## Our History

About 15 years ago we started looking for a location to build our farm. Five years later, after seeing dozens of places, one providentially fell into our laps. An acquaintance was selling some property at an auction. We had only two days notice, but we got our 23 acres of heaven (woodland actually, perfect for goats!) deciding to do as much as we could ourselves, we cleared a 700 foot road that bisects the property. First, we fenced several acres for our goats, building their housing at the same time. Then we built a pole barn/workshop. My husband said we needed that first--i wonder??-- so we could have a place to store building materials and tools. Finally came the clearing and grading for he house area, the house and moving in! we have many more  ideas for improvement. Like most, our farm is a work in progress.

## Location

Our farm is found between the two picturesque towns of Pumpkintown and Marietta. Located at the foot of the Appalachian mountains in upstate South Carolina, we enjoy an occasional snowfall some winters, long comfortable springs and falls, and warm summers perfect for growing things.
