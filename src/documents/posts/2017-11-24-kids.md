When babies are born they weigh an average of 2 lbs but within a few hours are very active. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. that way they wont accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.

Our babies are bottle-fed. We get them comfortable on a bottle, then you can continue if you want to take them home before they are 8 weeks old. I do recommend that does be kept on milk for 3 months especially if you want to show them.  We start them on goat’s milk and if the new owner doesn’t have goat's milk we convert them to WHOLE cows milk from the store--like what you drink. it takes about a week to convert them.
