Our herd is tested at least once a year for CAE, Johnes, and Brucellosis. We have never had a case of CL. if you don't know what these are google them. they are extremely bad for your goats, you and your farm... they can stay in the soil for YEARS. \

PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM ANY ONE WHO DOESN'T TEST THEIR GOATS. Also be sure to get copies of the results.

We give CD/T shots at least once a year to adults. We give a CD/T shot to pregnant does within 1 month of kidding. This is passed to the babies in utero giving them some protection at birth until they are able to get their own CD/T. All babies should be given one CD/T shot around 6 weeks old and another “booster” CD/T shot 21-28 days later.

_\*\*not sure if i should add this\*\*_ We are very strict on bio-security here so you will not be able to walk around Dozy Doe Down. (Johnes can be tracked on shoes) BUT we are very glad to have you come see the goats in a pen at the entrance of our farm.
