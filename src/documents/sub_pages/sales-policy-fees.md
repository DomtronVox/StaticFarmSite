SALES POLICY and FEES

We at Dozy Doe Down would really prefer NOT to need a Sales Policy, but over the years we’ve realized it is a necessary evil. So here goes…..



1) Once a goat leaves our possession we cannot take it back or exchange it. Also, we do not offer farm visits to “play with the goats.” This is due to our strict Bio-Security Policy.  

2) All sales are final. There will be no refunds once the goat leaves our possession.

3) We reserve the right to retain any animal born on our farm for any reason.

4) If we take a deposit for a goat/dog and if that animal dies between the deposit and it leaving our possession, we will refund the total deposit(s)  OR apply the total deposit(s) to another animal.

5) Goats are herd animals, so all goats will be sold at least in pairs.  Wethers we prefer to sell in groups of three. The exception: a single goat can be sold to a farm IF the farm has Nigerian Dwarf goats already.

6)  All registered animals that are sold will come with an application to be registered OR their original certificates. Signed transfers and Bill-of-Sale memos will be included if applicable. All fees for transferring or registering the animal to the new buyer will be the responsibility of the buyer. 

7) Animals sold as unregistered will not come with papers. If the owner of one of our unregistered goats would like to buy its registration papers for a fee, they can contact us.  All fees for transferring or registering the animal to the new buyer will be the responsibility of the buyer/owner. 

8) No doe is considered PREGNANT unless the new owner is willing to pay for a confirmed PG test. A doe “exposed” to a buck for possible breeding is NOT A GUARANTEE of pregnancy.  Understand that this might also include boarding fees while the doe is with the buck.



FEES:



Deposits:  A $50 non-refundable deposit is required to hold EACH goat/dog.

Payments: The $50 deposit and all payments made thereafter can be done through money order or PAYPAL. Send as “family/friends.” If fees are charged, you are responsible to pay them. All payments made before pickup will be non-refundable. 

Full Balance is due AT PICKUP (IN CASH) or BEFORE the animal can be shipped.

Boarding: $100 /week unless a different amount is agreed upon. It is your responsibility to pay for all needed vet expenses.

Vet Certificate of Health: this must be PREPAID. It is due for all animals being shipped or transported across state lines. Also, any required shots, medicines, and vaccines are to be paid before the animal can be shipped or transported.
