 Remember these IMPORTANT guidelines...

<br />

* Buy only from TESTED herds and ASK for the test results. Some diseases stay in your ground for YEARS. you want negative test results for CAE, CL, and Johnes. (we test for these and also for brucellosis on a regular basis). 

<br />

* Buy only POLLED or DISBUDDED goats. you DONT want your child (or you) losing an EYE or be permanently scarred. (my eye MD can tell some horrible stories of the operations he has done) 

<br />

* Why buy unregistered when you can buy registered goats?? they eat the same amt. take the same amt of time. give the same amt of love BUT you can sell the babies for 3x the amt of $$ you can sell unregistered goats for. they also are bred to produce WAY more milk. :) 

<br />

* Understand that ND kids are FERTILE at SIX WEEKS OLD but you should wait to wether the bucks until 3-4 months. so no mixing babies (ex.2 boys and 1 girl) 

<br />

5. **Have LOTS of FUN!!**
