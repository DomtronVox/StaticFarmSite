It was goat milk.

Jonathan Hartop walked nine miles a day at the age of 136 and lived to be 138.

Thomas Parr lived 152 years.

Peter Czartin from Austria lived to be 184.

All of these people lived on goat milk.

Goat milk neutralizes acids and toxins.

Goat milk is easily digested, making it the perfect food for children, elderly people, those with digestive difficulties, those recuperating from a disease or health conditions, and pets that have been weaned from their mother.

Goat milk is high in healing enzymes and has a superior form of calcium than cow milk.
