# LGDs For Sale

<br />

## All Livestock Guardian Dogs bred on our farm are born and raised with our goats and exposed to our chickens. They get deworming med at 2, 4, 6, and 8 wks of age. They are started on vaccinations at 6 weeks and every three weeks after. They get a puppy check at 4 weeks old.  All puppies are kept with their parents until **8 weeks** of age.

<br />

## If you desire or need (in the case of transport service)  another vet check with a health certificate before they leave, we are happy to help you but that is  an additional fee paid **before** the appointment.

## "**I got my puppy home. WHAT NOW?"**  We are happy to help you with questions. Also we strongly encourage you to join a group on facebook called ["Livestock Guardian Dogs and Positive Training Methods"  ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PositiveLGD/)They have many, many videos and posts you can read that are a BIG help.
