All Livestock Guardian Dogs bred on our farm are born and raised with our goats and exposed to our chickens. They get deworming med at 2, 4, 6, and 8 wks of age. They are started on vaccinations at 6 weeks and every three weeks after. They get a puppy check at 4 weeks old. If you desire or need (in the case of transport service)  another vet check with a health certificate before they leave, we are happy to help you but that is  an additional fee paid **before** the appointment.
