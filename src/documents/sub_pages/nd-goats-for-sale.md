ND Goats for Sale

Within a few hours of being born ND kids are very active. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. That way they won't accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.

<br />

Our babies are bottle-fed. We start them on goat’s milk and get them comfortable on a bottle then you can  continue if you want to take them home before they are 6 weeks old.  If you don’t have goat's milk available,  we convert them to WHOLE cow's milk from the store--like what you drink. it takes about a week to convert them. 

<br />

I do recommend that does be kept on milk for 3 months especially if you want to show them.
