# **ND Goats for Sale**

<br />

**Within a few hours of being born ND kids are very active. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. That way they won't accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.**

**<br />**

**All babies are taught to accept a bottle with teat. We will supply a free bottle and teat per total purchase. if you want to buy extra there is a small surcharge. We start them on goat’s milk. If you don’t have goat's milk available,  we are happy to convert them to WHOLE cow's milk from the store--like what you drink. it takes about a week to convert them.**

**<br />**

**I do recommend that doe Kids be kept on milk for 3 months especially if you want to show them.**
