# **ND Goats for Sale**

<br />

**Within a few hours of being born ND kids are very active. Running, playing, snuggling and laughing, children and goat kids thoroughly enjoy each other’s company. Nigerian Dwarf kids are the perfect size, clean, and totally harmless with the horns removed. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. This facilitates constant and safe handling for petting, milking, and showing. That way they wont accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.**

**<br />**

**All babies are taught to accept a bottle with teat. We will supply a free bottle and teat per total purchase. if you want to buy extra there is a small surcharge. We start them on goat’s milk. If you don’t have goat's milk available,  we are happy to convert them to WHOLE cow's milk from the store--like what you drink. it takes about a week to convert them.**

**I do recommend that doe Kids be kept on milk for 3 months especially if you want to show them.**
