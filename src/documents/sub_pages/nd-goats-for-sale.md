Within a few hours of being born ND kids are very active. We disbud all our goats unless they are born polled--genetically hornless. that way they wont accidentally put out a person eye--I've known it to happen.

our babies are bottle-fed. We get them comfortable on a bottle then you can  continue if you want to take them home before they are 6 weeks old. we start them on goat’s milk and if the new owner doesn’t have goat's milk we convert them to WHOLE cows milk from the store--like what you drink. it takes about a week to convert them. I do recommend that does be kept on milk for 3 months especially if you want to show them.
